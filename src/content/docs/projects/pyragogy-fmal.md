## üìö The FMAL Framework

**FMAL** (Foundational Model-Augmented Learning) represents a paradigm shift in the science of learning. Rather than viewing AI models as mere generative tools, FMAL reframes them as **cognitive partners** capable of:

- Augmenting human reasoning
- Supporting metacognitive development
- Contributing to knowledge construction through reflective interaction

### Core Thesis

FMAL positions AI systems not as autonomous agents but as cognitive tools designed to amplify human intelligence, deepen learning outcomes, and enhance reflective capacities.

### Key Shifts in Learning Approach

- From static information delivery to **dynamic reasoning support**
- From passive AI usage to **active epistemic collaboration**
- From knowledge transmission to **co-construction of understanding**


## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Flow

This paper introduces **FMAL** (Foundational Model-Augmented Learning), a novel paradigm in the science of learning where foundational models (like large language models) are not merely generative tools but are reframed as **cognitive partners**. These models are capable of augmenting human reasoning, supporting metacognitive development, and contributing to knowledge construction through reflective interaction.

The FMAL framework draws on advances in cognitive science, educational theory, and model alignment to argue that LLMs can serve as extensions of human cognition, scaffolding complex reasoning, offering explanations, generating alternative perspectives, and enabling self-reflective learning loops. Rather than replacing human thinking, these systems augment it by externalizing thought processes, making them inspectable, revisable, and improvable.

It highlights several core shifts:
- From static information delivery to **dynamic reasoning support**
- From passive AI usage to **active epistemic collaboration**
- From knowledge transmission to **co-construction of understanding**

Our approach centers on a repeated iterative process of the following two steps:

1. <span style="color:#EF8E8D"><b>PROPOSE</b></span>: The model generates reasoning tasks from abduction, deduction, and induction types. Tasks are validated with Python execution and assigned a learnability reward.

2. <span style="color:#5755A3"><b>SOLVE</b></span>: The model then attempts to solve these self-generated tasks. Solutions are verified through Python execution, receiving an accuracy reward.

The model continuously improves through both phases using TRR++, creating a self-evolving loop that strengthens reasoning without external training data.

## üåÄ Our Implementation Approach

The FMAL paradigm aligns perfectly with Pyragogy's mission. While FMAL introduces a theoretical framework, Pyragogy actively implements these concepts through:


### Proposed Initiative: Pyragogy x FMAL Lab

We're developing an experimental lab within the Pyragogy ecosystem where AI agents:

- Propose cognitive tasks based on FMAL's taxonomy (induction, deduction, abduction)
- Engage in AZR-style self-play and reflection
- Collaborate with human learners through structured diaries and feedback loops

We are preparing to share this implementation with the FMAL paper authors to explore potential collaboration.
